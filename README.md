Abstract:
A marketplace website built with React JS and MongoDB for a client. Has core funtionality of buying and selling items as well as a niche feature requested by the client: Groups. Users can join or create various themed groups where items can be listed privately or publicly to be sold within a certain group. As a standard there is also wishlisting functionality for users to easily bookmark their favourite items. However, the checkout process is handled simply and there is no payment verification; only marking items as "sold" on the database.
